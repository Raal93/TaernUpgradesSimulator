Taern Upgrade Simulator is a tool that helps players plan and organize upgrades for items.

To improve an item in Taern, the player has to collect a lot of valuable resources and then go to the blacksmith. The upgrade system works in such a way that each subsequent upgrade is more difficult. The first improvements have a 75-97% chance of success, but with each subsequent upgrade the chance decreases by a few percent.

The hardest part is that if you fail an upgrade, there is a high chance of resetting all upgrades. This is determined by the durability of the item.

To increase the chances of successful upgrades, the player can add various resources such as inhibitors, essences, rheoles, dvigs, and each attempt costs a lot of gold and requires the addition of an upgrade flask.

Due to the large amount of resources and the variety of configurations, many questions arise about optimizing the improvement process. This simulator gives players the opportunity to check the available opportunities, choose the optimal path and plan what resources will be needed.
